# part-2-
Project Description- This project is a continuation of the part 1 program created early,
it still has the same functions as part 1 though it uses generics instead of arrays.
This program allows the user to store multiple recipes with their recipe names,
prior to part 1 the user can now input the number of calories and the food group.
Delegates are used to notify when the number of calories exceed 300 and a unit test is made to calculte the total calory.
Usage Instruction- When runing the program, user will be prompted to enter tha name of the recipe
number of ingredients,quantity,steps, and a description on how to do it same as part 1
in addition, entering the food group and number of calories
once all is captured user will be prompted to choose if they would like to display, scale or reset recipe
if user chooses display, they can choose to either display by name or diplay in alphabetical order by name
